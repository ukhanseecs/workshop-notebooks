            "The problem of finding the longest substring without repeating characters is a classic example of a sliding window problem in the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This problem requires careful analysis, identification of key patterns, and selection of the appropriate algorithm and data structures to achieve an efficient solution.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Analyzing the Problem\n",
            "The problem can be stated as follows: Given a string `s`, find the longest substring that does not contain any repeating characters. For example, in the string \"abcabcbb\", the longest substring without repeating characters is \"abc\", which has a length of 3.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Identifying Key Patterns and Edge Cases\n",
            "- **Unique Characters**: The key pattern here is to identify a sequence of characters that do not repeat within the current substring.\n",
            "- **Edge Case 1**: An empty string should return a length of 0, as there are no characters.\n",
            "- **Edge Case 2**: A string with a single character should return a length of 1, as a single character by itself is considered a substring without repeating characters.\n",
            "- **Edge Case 3**: A string consisting entirely of unique characters (e.g., \"abcdefg\") should return the length of the entire string.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Choosing the Right Algorithm and Data Structures\n",
            "The most efficient algorithm to solve this problem is the sliding window approach, utilizing a map (or dictionary) to keep track of the characters in the current window and their last seen indices. This allows us to efficiently identify when a character is repeated in the window.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n",
            "1. **Initialize Variables**:\n",
            "   - `left` pointer to the start of the window\n",
            "   - `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum length of substring without repeating characters\n",
            "   - `charIndexMap` to store characters as keys and their last seen indices as values\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Iterate Through the String**:\n",
            "   - For each character at index `right`, check if it exists in `charIndexMap`.\n",
            "   - If it does, update the `left` pointer to be the character's last seen index + 1, ensuring we start a new window from after the previous occurrence of the repeating character.\n",
            "   - Update the `charIndexMap` with the current character and its index.\n",
            "   - Update `maxLength` if the current window size (i.e., `right - left + 1`) is greater than `maxLength`.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Return `maxLength`**:\n",
            "   - After iterating through the entire string, `maxLength` will hold the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
            "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we potentially visit each character twice (once with the `right` pointer and once with the `left` pointer).\n",
            "- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set (typically 128 for ASCII or larger for Unicode), as in the worst case, we might store every unique character in `charIndexMap`.\n",
